# cpiabotData
The CPIAbot glossary is a collection of simplified terms and definitions of high-frequency words that can be consulted through the CPIAbot chatbot.
The idea of developing a simplified interactive glossary, aimed at learners with poor language skills in Italian, stems from the lack of similar resources open-source or available online free of charge.

# Target
The reference target group of the glossary is made up of learners of Italian as L2, illiterated or low-educated adult immigrants.

The reference syllable 

Borri, A., Minuz, F., Rocca, L. & Sola, C. (2014). Italiano L2 in contesti migratori. Sillabo e descrittori dall’alfabetizzazione all’A1. Torino, IT: Loecher.

identifies 4 profiles/stages for adults with low skills in Italian L2:

+ PreAlphaA1 (pre-alphabetized)
+ AlphaA1(illiterate)
+ PreA1(weakly literate)
+ A1(literate)
